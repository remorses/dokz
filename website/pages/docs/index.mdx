# Introduction

Dokz enables you to quickly create live-reloading, seo-friendly, production-ready documentation sites with MDX.
It is based on `Next.js` so you get all its awesome features with it.

If you want to see how it looks just look read the documentation, this entire site is built with `Dokz` starting from some markdown files 🔥

# Features

## React components in markdown (MDX)

Mdx let you import react components in your documentation markdown to enrich the user experience.

## Preview react code

Dokz lets you preview react code with the `Playground` component

<Playground>
    <div style={{ padding: 40, height: 100, background: 'lightblue' }}>
        Hello World!
    </div>
</Playground>

## Automatic sidebar and table of contents

The sidebar is generated based on your markdown files inside the `pages` directory
The table of contents on the right is generated based on the heading elements inside the markdown document

## Dark mode

Dark mode is a must, the majority of developers work at night 🌙

Now that you know the core principles of Dokz. Let's [get started](/docs/getting-started)!

<Box my='40px' alignSelf='center'>
    <Button href='/docs/getting-started'>Get Started</Button>
</Box>

<Box my='40px' />
